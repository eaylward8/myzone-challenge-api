MongoDB install:
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/

Ideas for automating more of download/creation process:
- Request to finishedchallenges endpoint
  - Get challenge GUID
- Request to challengedetail endpoint using challenge GUID
  - Challenge details and leaderboard
  - Leaderboard has user GUIDs for all participants
- Request to movesbychallenge endpoint using challenge GUID
  - This gives all moves by all members of the challenge, but doesn't have a lot of detail
  - Get uNames and uGUIDs and find/create Athletes
  - Get move GUIDs for next step
- For each move GUID:
  - Request to movesbyguid endpoint using move GUID
  - Find/create Move (belongs to Athlete and Challenge)

sort2 = {'$sort': {'meps': -1}}
Move.collection.aggregate([sort]).to_a

Returns array of BSON::Documents with athlete IDs and mep totals, sorted from most to least
Move
  .collection
  .aggregate([{'$group': {_id: '$athlete_id', total: {'$sum': '$meps'}}}, {'$sort': {'$meps': -1}}])
  .each {|d| puts d}
